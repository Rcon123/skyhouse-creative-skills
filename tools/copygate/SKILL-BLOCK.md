## COLD-READ JUDGE (built 2026-10-27; ship block removed 2026-10-30; read cap and scope 2026-11-02)

SUPERSEDED 10-30: the "COLD-READ GATE (NOT optional, enforced by hooks)" block that stood here. Ryan, 10-30: "Get rid of
this thing that stops you from doing it because it's just wasting my time." The judge stays as a tool. (dreaming 2026-11-02, sessions 10-30_6aaa8a1e, 10-26_601f85f7, 10-28_fe5dc0fa, 11-02_0af56953)

1. **The reader is never the writer.** Before NEW copy reaches Ryan, run `python3 tools/copygate/coldread.py judge <file>`
   (add `--from "MASTHEAD:"` or `--section "<heading>"` so builder notes above the copy are not read). It prints the
   brief: spawn ONE fresh Agent (general-purpose, sonnet) with `tools/copygate/READER-PROMPT.md`; it runs `coldread.py
   text`, reads once as a stranger, and writes `coldread.py stamp <file> --reader subagent --json @<verdict>`. You never
   write a stamp for your own copy. Say once per session in the reply: the headless stranger is logged out and
   `claude login` in a terminal restores it. Never run `claude login` yourself.
2. **One read, one fix pass, at most one re-read.** Then ship with the remaining flags listed as notes at the top of the
   deliverable. Never a third read: every fresh reader finds a different line.
3. **Never run it on** unchanged copy, a CSS or image swap, a team brief, ClickUp task text, locked hooks or held-reveal
   headlines. Those fail every reader by design. A flag on a line Ryan locked is his call, not a fix.
4. **Their words, not ours.** Every mechanism word comes from `offers/<slug>/LANGUAGE.md` `## Their words`; a word you
   invent goes on `## Never`, not on the page.
5. **The judge is a tool, never a gate.** Nothing waits on a stamp: deploys, Doc pushes, handoffs and ClickUp go when he
   says go. ~~Nothing ships unstamped~~ (removed 10-30; `hook_pre_ship.py` exits 0).
6. **The mechanical floor runs itself** after every Write/Edit to `offers/<slug>/{ads,advertorials,landers,videos}/`.
   Fix dashes, banned words and long sentences before the judge, not after.

Tool and rules: `tools/copygate/README.md`.
